# To-do Web Application

---

## Description

This is a simpe web application that is meant to use JSON web token (jwt) authentication to access a To-do program
The To-do app is a simple program that is meant to be used as a to-do list.
A user will have to create signup/login to use the program itself.
I have built an accompanying server using Express to communicate with the React front-end and MongoDB database.

This application was simply made to test my skill and apply new knowledge. It is not an open source project.

This project is coded in **Javascript**

## Installation

This project was created on Windows OS and uses Node's package manager to start and use.

To run this application on your machine please follow these instructions:

- Open a terminal and clone the repository into your computer
- Install the necessary node modules by running **_npm install_**
- From the project directory, run the command **_npm start_**. This will start the backend server
- Open another instance of the terminal. "cd" into the client folder and run the command **_npm install_** to install the modules for the frontend application.
- Run the frontend by using the **_npm start_** command.
